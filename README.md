# MyBank â€“ Danger Password Banking App (Student Project)

## Overview
**MyBank** is a student project that demonstrates a secure banking concept with a **Danger Password** system.  
The app allows users to safely access their accounts in normal situations or under duress, showing only a limited balance when necessary.

## Problem
In many countries, criminals force people at gunpoint to transfer money from their bank accounts.  
Victims are often left helpless because refusing could put their lives at risk.

## Proposed Solution
The **Danger Password System** in MyBank provides two types of access:

1. **Normal Password**
   - Grants full access to the account.
   - All balances, cards, and transactions are visible.
   - Designed for everyday banking.

2. **Danger Password**
   
   - Shows only a limited balance (pre-set by the user).
